# PAINT.OK | Applications for joint drawing

## Do not use! The app is under development

PAINT.OK - Example of an app for drawing and communicating together  
The project uses technologies - [WebRTC], [Socket.io]

[WebRTC] technology allows you to establish formal and secure connections between clients,
but everything is possible in our world :). I am not responsible for your use of this project.
You are acting at your own risk.

[Socket.io] is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based
communication between the browser and the server.
